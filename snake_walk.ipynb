    "1. DB indexes: B-tree log(n), balanced tree, auto increment, PK. For compound PK - need another indexes\n",
    "2. cooperative concurrency and multitasking, semaphore, mutex.\n",
    "3. asynchronous: 2000 sockets, 100 are free now. Python lib: select, selectors (STL) - they implement concept of \"non-blocking sockets\" on OS level.\n",
    "4. levels of transactions, what anomalies each of them solve, ACID. Read the book: \"7 DBs for 7 days\". In Django there is method raw(), data mapper\n",
    "5. \"Clean architecture\" (Robert Martin). What is architecture: framework is infra for architecture. Use DTO. Use 'repository'(!) approach/interface. Read about DAO concept. DI - dependency inversion (container). Unit test is better with 'repository', abstraction.\n",
    "6. ! \"Architecture Patterns with Python\", 2020, by Harry Percival, Bob Gregory (it's good to read this book).\n",
    "7. Event-driven, event sourcing, microservices, Pub/Sub, Redis, RabittMQ. Business logic generates some events >> other services reacts on these events (e.g., in JSON format).\n",
    "8. RESTful, GraphQL, gRPC.\n",
    "9. Pay attention: Business logic (!)\n",
    "10. Pay attention: OS (!)\n",
    "11. Convert non-functional reqs in to \"money flow\". All tools are made for business optimization.\n",
