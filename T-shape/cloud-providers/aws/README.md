## Instance size (example)

| Instance Type | vCPUs | Memory (GiB) | Storage (GB) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| t4g.nano | 1 | 0.5 | EBS only |
| t4g.micro | 2 | 1 | EBS only |
| t4g.small | 2 | 2 | EBS only |
| t4g.medium | 2 | 4 | EBS only |
| t4g.large | 2 | 8 | EBS only |
| t4g.xlarge | 4 | 16 | EBS only |
| t4g.2xlarge | 8 | 32 | EBS only |

NB:

- Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost
- Instance store volumes are attached only at instance launch.
- You can't attach instance store volumes after launch.
- You can't attach instance store volumes after launch.
- An instance store volume exists only during the lifetime of the instance to which it is attached.
- You canâ€™t configure an instance store volume to persist beyond the lifetime of its associated instance.
- The data on an instance store volume persists even if the instance is rebooted. However, the data does not persist if the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated.
- **When the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated, every block of the instance store volume is cryptographically erased.**
- Therefore, do not rely on instance store volumes for valuable, long-term data.
- If you need to retain the data stored on an instance store volume beyond the lifetime of the instance, you need to manually copy that data to more persistent storage, such as an Amazon EBS volume, an Amazon S3 bucket, or an Amazon EFS file system.
  
## Pricing

### No additional fees

- EC2 Auto Scaling
- Elastic Beanstalk

### You only pay for the AWS resources

> The principal costs for a web application will typically be for the Amazon EC2 instance(s) and for the Elastic Load Balancing that distributes traffic between the instances running your application.

- EC2: number of instances needed to handle your web site traffic (includes pricing for On-demand, Reserved instances and Spot instances, load balancing, elastic block storage, and data transfer)
- Amazon EBS
- S3 buckets (includes pricing for storage and data transfer)
- Amazon RDS Pricing (includes pricing for database instances, backup storage, and data transfer)
- Amazon DynamoDB Pricing (include pricing for data storage, throughput capacity, and data transfer)

#### Multiple Storage Options

Amazon EBS is a durable, block-level storage volume that you can attach to a single, running Amazon EC2 instance. You can use Amazon EBS as a primary storage device for data that requires frequent and granular updates. For example, Amazon EBS is the recommended storage option when you run a database on Amazon EC2. Amazon EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an Amazon EC2 instance. Once a volume is attached to an instance you can use it like any other physical hard drive. Amazon EBS provides three volume types to best meet the needs of your workloads: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic. General Purpose (SSD) is the new, SSD-backed, general purpose EBS volume type that we recommend as the default choice for customers. General Purpose (SSD) volumes are suitable for a broad range of workloads, including small to medium sized databases, development and test environments, and boot volumes. Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes offer storage with consistent and low-latency performance, and are designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases. Magnetic volumes provide the lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types. Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important.

Many Amazon EC2 instances can also include storage from devices that are located inside the host computer, referred to as instance storage. Instance storage provides temporary block-level storage for Amazon EC2 instances. The data on instance storage persists only during the life of the associated Amazon EC2 instance.
In addition to block level storage via Amazon EBS or instance storage, you can also use Amazon S3 for highly durable, highly available object storage.

#### Elastic IPs

An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account. With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the internet. If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet. For example, this allows you to connect to your instance from your local computer.

##### Elastic IP address basics

    An Elastic IP address is static; it does not change over time.

    An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific Region only, and cannot be moved to a different Region.

    An Elastic IP address comes from Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses, or from a custom IPv4 address pool that you have brought to your AWS account.

    To use an Elastic IP address, you first allocate one to your account, and then associate it with your instance or a network interface.

    When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance, it is also associated with the instance's primary network interface. When you associate an Elastic IP address with a network interface that is attached to an instance, it is also associated with the instance.

    An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific network border group only.
